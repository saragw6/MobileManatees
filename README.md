## Overview

Mobile Manatees is a mobile app that displays photos of manatees with uplifting & comforting words to the user. Examples include “They’re clearly jealous of you” and “Don’t listen to your jerk brain, you are smart and pretty.”

The app also has an info page which describes the danger manatees are facing as a species, and links the user to savethemanatee.org to learn more.

## Usage Instructions
Click the “Bring me a manatee” button to load a new mobile manatee. Click the “i” button to view the info page to learn more. Users may use the “Visit their website to learn more” button to visit savethemanatee.org, or the return arrow to return to the app’s home screen.

## Running Requirements
Android 6.0 or greater

## Documentation and Resources Used
I used the Android developer documentation and Stack Overflow in the process of creating this app.

## What I Learned
In the process of making this app I familiarized myself with Android studio, and learned the basics of creating an Android app.
I’m now comfortable with the definitions of activities and views, and I know how to create a new activity and navigate to it using a Floating Action Button. I learned how to give my app permission to access the internet and how to format the contents of WebViews and TextViews.
